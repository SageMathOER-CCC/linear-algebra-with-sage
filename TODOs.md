## TODOs
* local development:
  * add/setup a watchdog utility to monitor ptx files' changes and retrigger a delayed build, and refresh the current rendering.
* add code styler/linter and set up precommit _(perhaps also switch to **pipenv** for package management_)

* Linear algebra logo: Linear Algebra relationship with Sage
* Getting started as common section to be pulled and customized, only change the new stuff, everything else to be kept elsewhere
* Fix the broken link [Jupyter Notebook] pointing to cocalc (`Sage in Browser` section in Getting Started: )
