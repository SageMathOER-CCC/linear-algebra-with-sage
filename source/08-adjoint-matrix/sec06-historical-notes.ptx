    <title>Historical Note: Adjoint vs. Adjugate</title>
    <introduction xml:id="subsec-historical-notes-on-sage-commands">
        <p>
            The terms "adjoint" and "adjugate" are often used interchangeably in linear algebra to refer
            to the same concept: the transpose of the cofactor matrix of a square matrix. However,
            historically, "adjoint" has been used in different contexts, such as in functional analysis
            to denote a different concept related to linear operators. In modern usage, especially in
            computational tools like Sage, "adjoint" is the preferred term for the matrix operation involving
            cofactors.

                A.adjugate() == A.adjoint()
