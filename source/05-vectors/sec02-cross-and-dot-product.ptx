        <p>
            Vectors do also support non-arithmetic operations, and operations that apply to the
            vector itself and its components.

            The <em>dot product</em> of two vectors <m>v=(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)</m> and
            <m>w=(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)</m> is defined as the sum of the products of
            their corresponding components <m>v \cdot w = w \cdot v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i w_i</m>.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                v = vector([1, 2, 3])
                w = vector([4, 5, 6])
                v.dot_product(w)
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Observe that the dot product of two vectors produces a scalar (a single number), not a
            vector. Also, note that the <em>dot</em> product in Sage is implemented in two ways:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                print(v * w)
                print(v.dot_product(w))
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            we can also compute the dot product manually by its definition
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                sum([v[i]*w[i] for i in range(v.degree())])
            </input>
        </sage>

            <idx>
                <h>Vectors</h>
                <h>Cross Product</h>
            </idx>
            The cross product of two vectors <m>v=(v_1, v_2, v_3)</m> and
            <m>w=(w_1, w_2, w_3)</m> is defined as the vector whose components
            are given by <m>v \times w = (v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2, v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3, v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1)</m>.
            In Sage, the cross product is calculated using the <c>cross_product</c> method.

            <input>
                v = vector([1, 2, 3])
                w = vector([4, 5, 6])
                v.cross_product(w)  # this yields a vector perpendicular to both v and w
