            There are a few commonly used vectors that could be useful in some contexts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <em>zero vector</em> has all components equal to zero and acts as the
                    additive identity.
                </p>
                <sage>
                    <input>
                        # A zeros vector of length/degree 3
                        zero_vec = vector([0] * 3)
                        zero_vec
                    </input>
                </sage>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <em>ones vector</em> has all entries equal to one and can represent uniform
                    distributions, constant signals, or summing components.
                </p>
                <sage>
                    <input>
                        # A ones vector of degree 4
                        ones_vec = vector([1] * 4)
                        ones_vec
                    </input>
                </sage>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    A normalized vector is a vector that has been scaled to have a norm of 1 (hence the name
                    <em>unit vector</em>). This is often done to simplify calculations or to ensure that the
                    vector represents only a direction without any magnitude. Normalizing a vector involves
                    dividing each component of the vector by its norm (or magnitude).
                </p>
                <sage>
                    <input>
                        # Normalizing a 3D vector
                        v = vector([3, 4, 0])
                        print("vector:", v, " with norm:", v.norm())

                        w = v.normalized()
                        print("Normalized vector:", w, " with norm:", w.norm())
                    </input>
                </sage>
                <p>
                    The normalized vector is a unit vector that points in the same direction as the original
                    vector. Normalizing a vector means scaling it so that it has length 1 while preserving
                    its direction. This is useful in applications such as directional vectors, unit basis
                    vectors, and simplifying computations involving angles or projections.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    A <em>basis vector</em> is a vector with all but one component equal to zero, and the one remaining
                    component exactly equals to one. It also has a norm of 1 (hence is also a unit vector name), and it
                    is often used to represent an independent dimension in a coordinate system for a vector space.
                </p>

                    <input>
                        # A basis vector of degree 5
                        basis_vec = vector([0, 1, 0, 0, 0])
                        print("Basis vector:", basis_vec, "with norm:", basis_vec.norm())
                    </input>
