    <title>Alternative Minors/Cofactors Computation</title>
    <introduction xml:id="subsec-alternative-computations-of-minors-and-cofactors">
        <p>
            Although there are no built-in methods in Sage to directly compute minors
            and cofactors are currently, we can leverage the command <c>adjugate</c>
            to compute them like shown below.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([
                    [1,   2,   3],
                    [5,   7,  11],
                    [13, 17,  19],
                ])
                C = A.adjugate().transpose()
                C
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            From the cofactors matrix, we then have access to cofactors <m>c_{ij}</m>,
            and from there to the minors <m>m_{ij}</m> like in the following example.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                c_12 = C[0, 1]
                print("c_12:", c_12)

                m_12 = (-1)^(1+2)*c_12 # divide/multiply by +/-1 are equivalent
                print("m_12:", m_12)
            </input>
        </sage>
