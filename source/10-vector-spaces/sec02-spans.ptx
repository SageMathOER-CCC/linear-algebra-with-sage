            The <term>span</term> of a set of vectors is the set
            of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. 
            It can be thought of as all the points in space that 
            can be reached by scaling and adding the vectors in the set.

        <p>
            If <m>S = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\}</m> is a set of vectors 
            in a vector space <m>V</m>, 
            then the span of <m>S</m>, denoted as <m>\operatorname{span}(S)</m>, is the set of all vectors of the form
            <me>a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \dots + a_k v_k</me>
            where <m>a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k</m> are scalars.

        In Sage, 
        the <c>span</c> command can be used to create the set of vectors
        that can be represented by linear combinations of these vectors. 
        Let's find the span of the vectors <m>(1, -1, 0)</m> and <m>(0, 1, -1)</m> in <m>\R^3</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            V = VectorSpace(RR, 3)
            S = V.span([vector([1, -1, 0]), vector([0, 1, -1])])
            S
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        We can now check if other vectors lie within this span. 
        For example, let's test if the vector <m>u = (2, 0, -2)</m>
        is in the span <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            u = vector([2, 0, -2])
            u in S
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        It is, because <m>u = 2 * (1, -1, 0) + 2 * (0, 1, -1)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's test a vector that is not in the span.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            v = vector([1, 1, 1])
            v in S
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
