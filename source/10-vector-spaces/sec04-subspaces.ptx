            A <term>subspace</term> is a vector space that is contained within another, 
            larger vector space. 
            For a vector space, <m>V</m>,
            a subset, <m>W \subset V</m>, 
            is a subspace if it satisfies the axioms of a vector space 
            under the same operations of <m>V</m>, 
            denoted as <m>W \leq V</m>.

            For a subset, <m>W</m>, of a vector space, <m>V</m>,
            to test if <m>W \leq V</m>,
            we only need to ensure the following hold:

        In Sage, we can create a subspace by providing a set
        of vectors that form a basis for it. 
        For example, 
        let's define a subspace of <m>\R^3</m> that is spanned by the vectors 
        <m>(1, 2, 3)</m> and <m>(4, 5, 6)</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            V = VectorSpace(RR, 3)
            W = V.subspace([vector([1, 2, 3]), vector([4, 5, 6])])
            W
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        We can then verify that <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            W.is_subspace(V)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
