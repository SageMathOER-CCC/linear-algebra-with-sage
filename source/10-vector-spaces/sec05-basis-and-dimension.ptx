            A set, <m>B_V</m>, that is a <term>basis</term> of a vector space, 
            <m>V</m>, if <m>B_V</m> is both linearly independent and spans the entire space, 
            <m>\operatorname{span}(B_V) = V</m>. 
            The number of vectors in a basis is called the <term>dimension</term>
            of the vector space and 
            all sets that form a basis, of the same space, 
            are of equal size.

        Sage implicitly computes the basis and dimension 
        of any subspace with the <c>span</c> command. 
        Let's start with a set of vectors that might be 
        linearly dependent and find the basis for the space they span.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            V = VectorSpace(RR, 4)
            # This set is linearly dependent
            vectors = [
                vector([ 1,  2,  0,  1]),
                vector([-1, -2,  0, -1]),
                vector([ 0,  1,  1,  0]),
                vector([ 1,  3,  1,  1])
            ]
            S = V.span(vectors)
            S

        Even though we started with four vectors, 
        the subspace they span is only two dimensional. 
        We can see the minimal set of vectors that form the 
        basis for this subspace using the <c>basis</c> command.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            S.basis()
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>

    <p>
        The <c>dimension</c> command simply returns the number of vectors in the basis.
    </p>

        <input>
            S.dimension()
