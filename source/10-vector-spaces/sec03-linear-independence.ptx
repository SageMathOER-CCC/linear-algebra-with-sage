            A set of vectors is <term>linearly independent</term> 
            if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. 
            In other words, 
            each vector in the set provides unique directional information that isn't redundant. 
            Formally, a set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\}</m>
             is linearly independent if the only solution to the equation
            <me>c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \dots + c_k v_k = \mathbf{0}</me>
            is <m>c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_k = 0</m>. 
            This is known as the trivial solution. 
            If there is any other solution (a non-trivial solution), 
            the set is said to be <term>linearly dependent</term>.

    <p>
        To check for linear independence in Sage, 
        we can create a matrix using the vectors as its rows. 
        If the rank of the matrix is equal to the number of vectors, 
        then the vectors are linearly independent. 
        Let's consider a set of vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            v1 = vector([1, 0, 0])
            v2 = vector([0, 1, 1])
            v3 = vector([1, 0, 1])
            
            # Create a matrix from the vectors
            M = matrix([v1, v2, v3])

            # Check if the rank is equal to the number of vectors
            M.rank() == len(M.rows())
        </input>
        <output>
            True
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        The result is <c>True</c>, 
        so the set <m>\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}</m> is linearly independent. 
        Now let's consider a linearly dependent set.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            u1 = vector([1, 2, 3])
            u2 = vector([4, 5, 6])
            u3 = vector([7, 8, 9])

            N = matrix([u1, u2, u3])
            N.rank() == len(N.rows())
        </input>
        <output>
            False
        </output>
    </sage>
