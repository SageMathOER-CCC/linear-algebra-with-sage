    <title>Definition of Vector Spaces</title>
    <introduction xml:id="sm-introduction-vector-spaces-definition">
            <p>
                A vector space provides an abstract generalization of the vectors in 
                <m>\R^n</m> defined before. 
                In <m>\R^n</m>, 
                vectors can be added and multiplied by real numbers. 
                Abstract vectors will have similar operations, 
                and scalars can be drawn from any field <m>\F</m>, 
                not exclusively <m>\R</m>.

                <p>
                    Fields have their own set of axioms, 
                    but for our purposes we will use pre-defined fields in Sage.
                    So you may think of them as a class in Sage.

                together with the operations, <m>+</m> vector addition

            As an example, 
            <m>\R^n</m> is a vector space over <m>\R</m>
            and the set <m>\F^n</m> of <m>n</m>-tuples <m>(a_1, \ldots, a_n)</m>
            where <m>a_i \in \F</m>
            forms a vector space over <m>\F</m>. 
            We will say that the dimension of these vector spaces is <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sage allows for us to create a vector space using the <c>VectorSpace</c> command. 
            We need to pass the field as well as the dimension of the space as arguments. 
            For instance, the following method creates the vector space <m>\R^3</m>:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                V = VectorSpace(RR, 3)
                V
            </input>
        </sage>
        <note>
            <title>Mantissa</title>
                <p>
                    By executing this command, we created a 3-dimensional vector space composed of Real numbers with 53 bits of precision.
                    The 53 bits are referred to as the mantissa, or the significand. The mantissa is the number of significant digits
                    that are in the floating point system. This signifies how precise the number can be.
                </p>
        </note>
        <p>
            Let's create now the vector space <m>\C^2</m>
            of pairs of complex numbers:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                W = VectorSpace(CC, 2)
                W
            </input>
            <output>
                
            </output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Equivalently, we can define the same vector space as:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                W = CC ^ 2
                W
            </input>
            <output>
                
            </output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            We can check if a vector belongs to a vector space. Like this:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                v = vector(RR, [1,3,4])
                # Ensure that the vector is over the same field
                v in V
            </input>
            <output>
                
            </output>
        </sage>
        <!-- 
        <p>
        Interestingly, polynomials with real coefficients also satisfy the definition of a vector space.
        We can construct the vector space containing polynomials, with a variable <m>x</m>, of maximum degree 3 as follows:
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
        P_3 = VectorSpace(RR, PolynomialRing(RR, var('x'), 4))
        P_3
        </input>
        </sage>
        <note>
        <title>Free Modules</title>
        <p>
        The return type of <c>VectorSpace</c> is a <c>FreeModule</c>
        as opposed to a vector space class.
        This is a more general term and in this context can be interpreted as a vector space.
        </p>
        </note>
        <p>
        It is required by Sage to specify the variable of the polynomial when we are working with polynomials.
        </p>
