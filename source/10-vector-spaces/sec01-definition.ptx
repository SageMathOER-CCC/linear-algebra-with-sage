                <m>+</m> vector addition and <m>*</m> scalar multiplication,

            <title>Fields</title>
            <p>
                Sage and more abstract forms of linear algebra use a general field
                for scalars instead of <m>\R</m>.
                Fields and their properties are outside of the scope of this book
                and we will hereby be using <m>\R</m> (or <c>RR</c> in Sage)
                as our field.
            </p>
        </note>
    </introduction>
    <p>
        Sage allows for us to create a vector space using the <c>VectorSpace</c>
        command. We will primarily be working in the vector space given by the Euclidean space <m>\R^n</m>.
        To create the vector space in <m>\R^3</m>, we may use the following command.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            V = VectorSpace(RR, 3)
            V
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <note>
        <title>Mantissa</title>
            <p>
                By executing this command, we created a 3-dimensional vector space composed of Real numbers with 53 bits of precision.
                The 53 bits are referred to as the mantissa, or the significand. The mantissa is the number of significant digits
                that are in the floating point system. This signifies how precise the number can be.
            </p>
    </note>
    <p>
        Interestingly, polynomials with real coefficients also satisfy the definition of a vector space.
        We can construct the vector space containing polynomials, 
        with a variable <m>x</m>, of maximum degree 3 as follows:
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            P_3 = VectorSpace(RR, PolynomialRing(RR, var('x'), 4))
            P_3
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <note>
        <title>Free Modules</title>
        <p>
            The return type of <c>VectorSpace</c> is a <c>FreeModule</c>
            as opposed to a vector space class.
            This is a more general term and in this context can be interpreted as a vector space.
        </p>
    </note>
    <p>
        It is required by Sage to specify the variable of the polynomial when we are working with polynomials.
