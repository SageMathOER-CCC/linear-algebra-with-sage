            A normalized vector is a vector that has been scaled to have a norm of 1 (hence the name
            <em>unit vector</em>). This is often done to simplify calculations or to ensure that the
            vector represents only a direction without any magnitude. Normalizing a vector involves
            dividing each component of the vector by its norm (or magnitude).

            <input>
                # Normalizing a 3D vector
                v = vector([3, 4, 0])
                w = v.normalized()

                print("vector(v):", v, " with norm:", v.norm())
                print("Normalized vector(w):", w, " with norm:", w.norm())

            The normalized vector is a unit vector that points in the same direction as the original
            vector. Normalizing a vector means scaling it so that it has length <m>1</m> while
            preserving its direction. This is useful in applications such as directional vectors, unit
            vectors, and simplifying computations involving angles or projections.
