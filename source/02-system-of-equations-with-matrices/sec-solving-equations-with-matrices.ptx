    <title>Solving Equations with Matrices</title>
    <p>
        As an introduction to solving equations in Sage, we worked with equations symbolically. Now, we will learn how to solve systems of equations with vectors and matrices.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can represent a system of equations with an <term>augmented matrix</term> of a system. Each row in the augmented matrix lists the coefficients of the variables in an equation. While we do not directly manipulate the variables themselves, they indicate the position of each coefficient. The last column of the augmented matrix contains the constants from the right-hand side of each equation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's solve the following system of equations:
    </p>
    <md>
        <mrow>\amp x + 2y \amp = 4</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp y - z \amp = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp x + 2z \amp = 4</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
        Let's start by creating the augmented matrix.
    </p>
    <md>
        <mrow>
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 
        1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 4 \\ 
        0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp 0 \\ 
        1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 4 
        \end{array}\right]
        </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
         In Sage, we can create an coefficient matrix using the <code>matrix</code> function.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = matrix(
                    [[1, 2, 0], 
                    [0, 1, -1], 
                    [1, 0, 2]
                ])
            print(A)
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Next, provide a list of constants to the <c>vector</c> function.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            b = vector([4, 0, 4])
            print(b)
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Finally, call the <c>solve_right</c> method on the matrix and pass the solution vector as its argument.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A.solve_right(b)
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
