    <title>Solving Equations with Matrices</title>
    <p>
        As an introduction to solving equations in Sage, we worked with equations symbolically. Now, we will update our examples by using vectors and matrices. Returning to the system of of two equations, <m>2x + 3y = 4</m> and <m>5x - 6y = 7</m>, we can define a matrix and a vector to represent the system.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = matrix([
                    [2, 3], # 2*x + 3*y
                    [5, -6] # 5*x - 6*y
                ])
            b = vector([4, 7])
            A.solve_right(b)
        </input>
        <output>

        Returning to the system of three equations, <m>x + y + z = 6</m>, <m>2x - z = -1</m>, and <m>x - y - z = -4</m>, we can define a matrix and a vector to represent the system.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = matrix([
                    [1, 1, 1], # x + y + z
                    [2, 0, -1], # 2*x - z
                    [1, -1, -1] # x - y - z
                ])

            b = vector([6, -1, -4]) # Right-hand side
            A.solve_right(b)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
