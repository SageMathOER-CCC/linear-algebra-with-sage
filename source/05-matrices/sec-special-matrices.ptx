            Some matrices occur frequently enough to be given special names:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The <em>zero matrix</em> contains only zeros and acts as the additive identity.

                            # 3x3 zero matrix

                        A <em>diagonal matrix</em> is a square matrix that has zero entries everywhere outside
                        the <em>main diagonal</em>. Note that a diagonal matrix may have some or all its diagonal
                        entries equal to <m>0</m> (recall that the main diagonal runs from the top left to the
                        bottom right of the matrix, while the secondary diagonal runs from the top right to the
                        bottom left).

                            d = diagonal_matrix([2, 4, 6])

                        Diagonal matrices are simple to multiply and often appear in eigenvalue problems which
                        we will see in upcoming chapters. To check if a matrix is diagonal, the method
                        <c>is_diagonal()</c> can be used.

                        An <em>identity matrix</em> is a diagonal matrix with all its diagonal elements
                        equals to 1.
                    </p>
                    <sage>
                        <input>
                            # 5x5 diagonal matrix
                            identity_matrix(5)

                        Although the <em>ones</em> matrix is not a predefined matrix in Sage, it is common in
                        other similar computational frameworks such as Octave©, and MATLAB©. Essentially,
                        it is a matrix where every entry is 1. It can be created by leverage the built-in list
                        duplication operator <c>*</c> applied on a list of ones.
                    </p>

                        <input>
                            # 2x4 matrix with all entries equal to 1
                            matrix([[1]*4]*2)
                        </input>
                    </sage>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <idx>
                        <h>Matrices</h>
                        <h>Upper Triangular Matrix</h>
                        <h>Lower Triangular Matrix</h>

                        Two other common types of matrices are the <em>Upper</em> and <em>Lower</em> triangular matrices:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An Upper Triangular Matrix is a square matrix where all entries below the main diagonal are zero.
                    </p>
                    <sage>
                        <input>
                            # 3x3 Upper triangular matrix
                            Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [0, 4, 5], [0, 0, 6]])
                        </input>
                    </sage>
                    <p>
                        A Lower Triangular Matrix is a square matrix where all entries above the main diagonal are zero.
                    </p>
                    <sage>
                        <input>
                            # 3x3 Lower triangular matrix
                            Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [2, 4, 0], [3, 5, 6]])
                        </input>
                    </sage>
                    <p>
                        Sage does not have these last two as predefined command. They can however be obtained by
                        leveraging the <c>LU()</c> method that we will see in the next section.
