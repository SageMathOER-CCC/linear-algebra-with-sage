            Matrix arithmetic extends familiar operations like addition and multiplication to the
            world of matrices. We will learn how to add, subtract, and multiply matrices, explore
            properties of these operations, and see how they're used to solve systems of equations,
            represent compositions of transformations, and work with data in structured ways.

            Matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied. However, unlike matrix multiplication,
            the addition and subtraction of matrices are performed element-wise. The identity matrix
            serves as the multiplicative identity for matrices, and the zero matrix serves as the
            additive identity.

                # Defining two 3x3 matrices
                A = matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
                B = matrix([[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]])

                # Matrix addition.
                A + B

            Multiplication with matrices comes in several forms. Scalar multiplication scales every entry
            in a matrix by a constant. Matrix-vector multiplication treats the vector as a column and
            combines it with the matrix using <em>dot</em> products. Matrix-matrix multiplication is
            only defined when the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in
            the second, and is performed by computing dot products of rows and columns.

                # Scalar multiplication
                A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
                3 * A
            </input>

        <sage>
            <input>
                # Matrix-vector multiplication
                v = vector([1, 2])
                A * v
            </input>
        </sage>

        <sage>
            <input>
                # Matrix-matrix multiplication
                B = matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
                A * B
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            Note that to use the result of these operations, you would need to assign them to a variable.
