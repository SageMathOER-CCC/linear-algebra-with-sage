            The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal, swapping rows with columns.
            The transpose is denoted as <m>A^T</m> and can be computed in Sage using the <c>transpose</c> method:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]])
                A.transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>

            </idx>
            A matrix <m>A</m> is <em>symmetric</em> if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., <m>A = A^T</m>.
            Sage offers <c>is_symmetric()</c> method to check if a matrix is symmetric.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.is_symmetric()
            </input>
        </sage>

            </idx>
            For matrices with complex entries, the complex conjugate is found by taking the conjugate of
            each individual entry. This operation is often used in conjunction with the transpose to form
            the conjugate transpose (also called the Hermitian transpose)
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix(CC, [[1 + 2*I, 3 - I], [-2*I, 4]])
                A.conjugate()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Matrices with Complex values, and computing conjugates are very common in signal processing
            and quantum mechanics.

            </idx>
            Just like vectors, matrices also has a norm quantity defined. But unlike vectors, there are
            several types of norms for matrices. The method <c>norm</c> in Sage returns the Frobenius
            norm which is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of all the entries in the
            matrix.

                # The norm of a matrix
                A = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
                A.norm()
