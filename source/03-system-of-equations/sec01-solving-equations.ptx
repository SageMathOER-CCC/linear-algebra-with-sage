    <title>Solving Equations</title>
    <p>
        The <c>solve</c> function algebraically solves an equation or system of equations. 
        We will begin by focusing on solving a single equation. 
        By default, Sage assumes the expression is equal to <m>0</m>. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Let's solve for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>8 + x = 0</m>. 
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            solve(8 + x, x)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>

        Let's solve for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>8 + x = 5</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            solve(8 + x == 5, x)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>

        We can store the equation in a new variable and perform operations on it. 
        Recall the single equal sign (<c>=</c>) is the <term>assignment operator</term>, while the double equal sign (<c>==</c>) is the <term>equality operator</term>. 
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define the equation and store it in a variable
            E = 8 + x == 5

            # Solve the equation for x
            solve(E, x)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Observe that the solution of an equation is given between square brackets, indicating that the data type is a <c>list</c>. 
        We can access the solutions in the <c>list</c> with square brackets. 
        Notice that after accessing the solution, the brackets are no longer present. 
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
        # Define the equation and store it in a variable
        E = 8 + x == 5

        # Store the solution in a variable
        S = solve(E, x)

        # Access the zero-th element of the list
        S[0]
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        In this case the <c>list</c> has only one element.
        However, other equations may have multiple solutions and therefore multiple elements in the <c>list</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also access each side of the equation. Here is the right-hand side of the equation.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            E.rhs()
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Here is the left-hand side of the equation.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            E.lhs()
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        To use a variable other than <c>x</c>, we need to create a <term>symbolic</term> variable object with the <c>var()</c> function. 
        Otherwise, Sage will not recognize the variable as a symbolic variable.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
        # Create a symbolic variable
        var('z')

        # Solve for z
        solve(8 + z == 5, z)
        </input>
        <output>

        </output>
    </sage>
