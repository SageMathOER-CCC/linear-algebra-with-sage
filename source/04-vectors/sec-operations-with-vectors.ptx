        <p>
            A vector in <m>R^n</m> is an ordered collection of <m>n</m> numbers, represented as
            <m>(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)</m>, where each <m>v_i</m> is a number in <m>R</m>. In the
            two-dimensional space <m>R^2</m>, for example, vectors are represented a pair <m>(x, y)</m>,
            and in three-dimensional space <m>R^3</m>, vectors are represented by triples <m>(x, y, z)</m>.

            In this section, we will introduce how to perform the arithmetic operations on vectors in Sage.

            Vectors can be added and subtracted using the <c>+</c> and <c>-</c> operators.
            The result of adding or subtracting two vectors is a new vector with the
            same number of components.

            A vector components can be <em>scaled</em> by a factor using scalar multiplication and the
            <c>*</c> operator. Here is an example of scalar multiplication of a vector by 2.
