        <p>
            The key detail about a vector is that it provides both a magnitude and a direction
            in a given space. A vector in <m>R^n</m> is an ordered collection of <m>n</m> numbers,
            represented as <m>(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)</m>, where each <m>v_i</m> is a number in <m>R</m>.
        </p>

        <p> The space <m>R^n</m> refers to an <m>n</m>-dimensional space where each vector
            corresponds to a <em>point</em> or a <em>direction</em>. In the two-dimensional space <m>R^2</m>,
            for example, vectors are represented a pair <m>(x, y)</m>, and in three-dimensional space
            <m>R^3</m>, vectors are represented by triples <m>(x, y, z)</m>.

            In this section, we will see introduce how to perform the arithmetic operations on vectors in Sage.

            Vectors can be added and subtracted using the <c>+ and -</c> operators.
            The result of adding or subtracting two vectors is a new vector with the
            same number of components.

            A vector can be multiplied by a scalar using the <c>*</c> operator.
            The result is a new vector with each component multiplied by the scalar.
