            Vectors do also support non-arithmetic operations, and operations that apply to the
            vector itself and its components.

            For instance, another form of vector multiplication is the <em>dot</em> product, where
            two vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m> are multiplied with each other to produce
            a <em>scalar</em> value. The dot product of two vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>
            is defined as the sum of the products of their corresponding components. The
            dot product is commutative and yields a scalar value
            <m>v \cdot w = w \cdot v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i w_i</m>.

                v = vector([1, 2, 3])
                w = vector([4, 5, 6])
                v.dot_product(w)

        <p>
            Note that the <em>dot</em> product in Sage is implemented in more than one way. All the
            following statements are equivalent and produce the same result.

            <input>
                print(v * w)
                print(v.dot_product(w))
                print(sum([v[i]*w[i] for i in range(v.degree())]))

            The cross product of two vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m> is defined only in 3D space
            and is calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the unit vectors
            <m>i, j, k</m> and the components of the vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>. In Sage,
            the cross product is calculated using the <c>cross_product</c> method.
