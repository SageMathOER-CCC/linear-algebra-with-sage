    <p>This book is the second in a series of textbooks designed to provide instruction on using
      SageMath to study various subjects in undergraduate mathematics. In this volume, we focus
      on using Sage in a first-year course on Linear Algebra.
    </p>

    <p>The goal is not to present a comprehensive treatment of Linear Algebra, but rather to offer
      a clear and accessible introduction to Sage's robust capabilities for working with vectors,
      matrices, systems of equations, and linear transformations.
    </p>

    <p>This book was written by undergraduate students at Wright College who were enrolled in my
      Math 299 class, Writing in the Sciences.
    </p>

    <p>For many years, I have been teaching Linear Algebra using the open source mathematical
      software SageMath. Despite the fabulous capabilities of this software, students were often
      frustrated by the lack of specific documentation geared towards beginning undergrad students
      in Linear Algebra.
    </p>

    <p>This book was born out of this frustration and the desire to make our own contribution
      to the Open Education movement, from which we have benefitted greatly. In the context of
      Open Pedagogy, my students and I ventured into a challenging learning experience based on
      the principles of freedom and responsibility. Each week, students wrote a chapter of this
      book. They found the topics and found their voice. We critically analyzed their writing,
      and they edited and edited again and again. They wrote code, tested it and polished it. In
      the process, we all learned so much about Sage, and we found some bugs in the software that
      are now in the process of being fixed thanks to its very active community of developers.
    </p>

    <p>The result is the book we dreamed of having when we first attempted Linear Algebra with Sage.
      Our book is intended to provide concise and complete instructions on how to use different Sage
      functions to solve problems in Linear Algebra. Our goal is to streamline the learning process,
      helping students focus more on mathematics and reducing the friction of learning how to code.
      Our textbook is interactive and designed for all math students, regardless of programming
      experience. Rooted in the open education philosophy, our textbook is, and always will be,
      free for all.
    </p>

    <p>I am very proud of the work of my students and hope that this book will serve as inspiration
      for other students to take ownership of a commons-based education. Towards a future where
      higher education is equally accessible to all.

    <!-- TODO. Would need to be revisited / refined and updated -->
    <p>
      This book reflects a shared commitment to collaboration and the ideals of Open Education. Its purpose is to broaden access to higher learning by offering clear and welcoming materials that help students engage with open-source tools in mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are especially grateful to Hellen Colman, Professor of Mathematics at Wright College, our co-author, and our guiding compass and lighthouse, helping us navigate forward with purpose and direction. Her depth of mathematical knowledge helped maintain the precision and significance of the content. Drawing inspiration from her Linear Algebra online lectures and at the City Colleges of Chicago-Wilbur Wright College, this work has benefited greatly from her mentorship and encouragement. Her confidence in us played a key role in influencing our thinking and methods, from the Linear Algebra coursework through the development of this OER.
    </p>

    <p>
      We extend our appreciation to our peer reviewers and proofreaders, whose careful and thorough work helped maintain the precision and readability of this textbook. Their efforts were vital to the successful completion of this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developing this text was a true team endeavor, shaped by the dedication and motivation of many contributors. The standard of the final result speaks to our combined efforts and shared passion. Most importantly, we extend our sincere appreciation to all who contributed to making this endeavor become a reality. Their commitment and spirit of cooperation have left a meaningful and enduring mark on this work and on Open Education as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are also thankful for the many skilled developers and mathematicians across open-source communities. The PreTeXt community was central to our writing workflow, and the SageMath community contributed invaluable disciplinary insight. We sincerely acknowledge everyone involved in building Sage, as well as the creators of PreTeXt.
