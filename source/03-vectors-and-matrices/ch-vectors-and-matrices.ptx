    <title>Vectors and Matrices</title>

    <introduction>
        <p> Vectors and matrices are fundamental objects in linear algebra, playing a crucial
        role in representing mathematical entities (like lines, planes, and spaces) or modeling geometric
        and physical quantities (like velocity, acceleration, momentum, force, electric and magnetic fields).
        As such, they are central to many applications across various fields, from physics, to computer science,
        engineering, and data science. </p>

        <p> In this chapter, we explore vectors in <m>R^n</m> and their
        representation in two-dimensional (<m>2D</m>) and three-dimensional (<m>3D</m>) spaces,
        vectors defined by points in these spaces, as well as examining key operations on vectors.</p>

        <p> Also, we introduce matrices, which can be interpreted as a natural expansion of vectors into
        higher dimensions. Just like vectors, we'll see how matrices are defined, basic matrix operations,
        and see how they can be a very powerful tool for solving systems of equations, performing
        geometric transformations, and modeling complex relationships between data. </p>
