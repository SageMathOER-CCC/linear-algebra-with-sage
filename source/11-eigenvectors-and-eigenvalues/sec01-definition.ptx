    <introduction>
        <p>
            An <term>eigenvector</term> of a square matrix <m>A</m> is a non zero vector whose direction is unchanged when multiplied by <m>A</m>.
            Formally, for a vector <m>v</m>, this relationship is expressed as:
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow> Av = \lambda v </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            Here, <m>\lambda</m> is a scalar known as the <term>eigenvalue</term>
            associated with the eigenvector <m>v</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we will show how to use Sage to calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix, and then
            we will proceed with the calculations of its eigenvectors.
