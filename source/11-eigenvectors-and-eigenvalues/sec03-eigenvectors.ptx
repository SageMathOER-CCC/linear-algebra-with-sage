    <title>Eigenvectors</title>

        <p>
            In this section, we will learn how to compute eigenvectors of a matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall the definition of an eigenvector which we used to solve for <m>\lambda</m>.
            Using these eigenvalues we can create a matrix equation of the form:
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow> (A - \lambda I) v = 0 </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            We can obtain <m>v</m> by substituting a value of <m>\lambda</m>, we will chose <m>\lambda = 6</m>.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([
                    [6, 0],
                    [4, 2],
                    ])
                B = A - 6 * identity_matrix(2)
                B</input>
            <output>

            </output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            Then using the <c>right_kernel()</c> method Sage can solve this equation for us.
            Since Sage uses the left-kernel while our formula uses right multiplication,
            we must specify to use right-kernel.

        <sage>
            <input>
                B.right_kernel()
                B.right_kernel()</input>
            <output>
            </output>
        </sage>
        <p> We can find all eigenvectors of <m>A</m> with the <c>eigenvectors_right()</c> method.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.eigenvectors_right()</input>
            <output>

            </output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            The output is a list containing elements of the form <c>(e, [v_1, v_2, ... v_n], m)</c>,
            where <c>e</c> is the eigenvalue,
            <c>v_1</c> through <c>v_n</c> are the corresponding eigenvectors,
            and <c>m</c> is how many times <c>e</c>
            appears as a root in the characteristic polynomial (also referred to as algebraic multiplicity).
