            Matrices can be added, scaled by a scalar (scalar multiplication), or multiplied with
            other matrices (matrix multiplication). Addition and scalar multiplication are performed
            element-wise, analogous to the corresponding operations on vectors.

            Matrix multiplication is an operation between two matrices where the rows of the first
            matrix are multiplied (<em>dot product</em>) by the columns of the second matrix to produce
            the matrix product. For the multiplication to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix must
            equal the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix has the same number of
            rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix.

                            [0, 3, 5, 8, 6],
                            [9, 1, 0, 4, 2]])

            In the case of multiplying a matrix by a vector, the vector is treated as a matrix with a single column.
            The output however is of type <c>Vector</c> and is <em>not</em> of type <c>Matrix</c>.
