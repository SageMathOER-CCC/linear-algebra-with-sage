            The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal, swapping rows with columns.
            The transpose is denoted as <m>A^T</m> and can be computed in Sage using the <c>transpose</c> method:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]])
                A.transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>

                <h>Symmetric</h>
            </idx>
            A matrix <m>A</m> is <em>symmetric</em> if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., <m>A = A^T</m>.
            Sage offers <c>is_symmetric()</c> method to check if a matrix is symmetric.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.is_symmetric()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            In some fields like signal processing and quantum mechanics, working over complex vector spaces
            is necessary and common. The <em>conjugate transpose</em> matrix is defined as the transpose
            of the conjugate matrix. In Sage, the conjugate transpose of a matrix is obtained by first
            computing its conjugate then taking the transpose.

                <h>Complex Conjugate</h>
            </idx>
            To find the conjugate of a matrix in Sage, we use the <c>conjugate()</c> method.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[1 + 2*I, 3 - I], [-2*I, 4]])
                B = A.conjugate()
                B
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            <idx>
                <h>Matrices</h>
                <h>Conjugate Transpose</h>
            </idx>
            Then, we compute the transpose of that conjugate matrix using the transpose method shown earlier.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                B.transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            We can also calculate the conjugate transpose directly using the <c>conjugate_transpose</c> method.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.conjugate_transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            <idx>
                <h>Matrices</h>
                <h>Hermititan Transpose</h>
                <h>Transjugate</h>
            </idx>
            The conjugate transpose of a matrix <m>A</m> is called the Hermitian transpose, Hermititan conjugate,
            or transjugate and is denoted <m>A^*</m>, <m>A^{H}</m> or <m>A^{\dagger}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conjugate transpose matrix is also called the <em>Adjoint</em> matrix; however, this terminology will not be used
            in this book to avoid confusion with the <em>Adjugate</em> concept introduced in chapter 8. 
            Historically, "<em>Adjoint</em>" was used to refer to both concepts, see historical notes in chapter 8 for more details.
