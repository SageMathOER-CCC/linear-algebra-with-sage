            The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal, swapping rows with columns.
            The transpose is denoted as <m>A^T</m> and can be computed in Sage using the <c>transpose</c> method:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]])
                A.transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>

            </idx>
            A matrix <m>A</m> is <em>symmetric</em> if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., <m>A = A^T</m>.
            Sage offers <c>is_symmetric()</c> method to check if a matrix is symmetric.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.is_symmetric()
            </input>
        </sage>

            In some fields like signal processing and quantum mechanics, working over complex vector spaces
            is necessary and common. the <em>conjugate transpose</em> is obtained by first taking the complex
            conjugate of each entry of <m>A</m>, and then transposing the resulting matrix. We use <c>conjugate()</c>
            method to find the conjugate of a matrix in Sage.

            </idx>
            For matrices with complex entries, the conjugate is found by taking the conjugate of
            each individual entry. This operation is often used in conjunction with the transpose to form
            the conjugate transpose (also called the Hermitian transpose)

            <input>
                A = matrix([[1 + 2*I, 3 - I], [-2*I, 4]])
                A.conjugate()

            In some fields like signal processing and quantum mechanics, working over complex vector spaces is
            necessary and common. In these contexts, the <em>conjugate transpose</em> is obtained by first finding
            the conjugate matrix taking the complex conjugate of each entry of <m>A</m>, and then transpose it.

            The conjugate transpose of a matrix <m>A</m> is called the Hermitian transpose, Hermititan conjugate,
            or transjugate and is denoted <m>A^*</m>, <m>A^{H}</m> or <m>A^{\dagger}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conjugate transpose matrix is also called the <em>Adjoint</em> matrix; however, we will not use
            this name in this book. We will reserve it for a different concept introduced in chapter 8.

            In Sage, the conjugate transpose of a matrix can be computed using the <c>conjugate_transpose</c> method:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.conjugate_transpose()
            </input>
        </sage>
