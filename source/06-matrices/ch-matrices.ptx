            Matrices are often interpreted as a natural expansion of vectors into higher dimensions.
            But, the concept of a matrix extends beyond the simple grid of numbers; in fact, matrices
            serve as mathematical tool for structuring data, encoding relationships between multiple
            quantities, representing linear transformations, or solving systems of equations.

            In this chapter, we will see most common matrix operations often used in linear algebra.
