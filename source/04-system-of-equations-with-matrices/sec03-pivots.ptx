    <title>Pivots</title>
    <p>
        The concept of pivots give us the ability to differentiate how many "dimensions" a system of equations' solutions has.
        Pivots refer to the following features of a matrix's <term>reduced row echelon form</term>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Each leading <m>1</m> denotes a pivot 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <term>pivot position</term> refers to the row and column a pivot inhabits
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <term>pivot column</term> refers to the column in which a pivot inhabits
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Rows that consist entirely of zeros do not contain pivots.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sage has a built in <c>pivot()</c> method which returns the, 
        zero-indexed, pivot columns of each row and excludes rows without pivots as a <c>list</c>.
    </p>

        Here is an example with <m>\textbf{Case I}</m>:
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = matrix([ # Re-use Case I matrix
                    [0, 1, -1, 0],
                    [1, 2, 0, 4],
                    [1, 0, 1, 4] 
                ])
            A.pivots()
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Here is an example with <m>\textbf{Case II}</m>:
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            M = matrix([
                    [1, 2, 0, 4],
                    [0, 1, -1, 0],
                    [1, 0, 2, 4]
                ])
            M.pivots()
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Here is another example of a system with infinitely many solutions but this time with one pivot.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            C = matrix([
                    [3, 3, 1, 1],
                    [9, 9, 3, 3],
                    [6, 6, 2, 2]
                ])
            print(C.rref())
            print(C.pivots())
        </input>
        <output>
            
        </output>
    </sage>
    <p>
        This is what was referred to earlier by the "dimensions", more formally referred to as degrees of freedom, the solutions inhabit.
