    <title>Matrix Equations</title>
    <p>
        We can represent a system of equations as a matrix equation by writing <m>Ax = b</m>
        where <m>A</m> is the coefficient matrix,
        <m>x</m> is the vector of variables, and <m>b</m> is the vector of constants.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can solve a matrix equation in Sage using the method <c>solve_right()</c>. 
        Evaluating <c>A.solve_right(b)</c> returns a vector <m>x</m> such that <m>Ax = b</m>. 
        The components of this vector are the values of the solution.

            Let's now solve the <m>\textbf{Case I}</m> system applying the matrix equation method.

                ])
                b = vector([0, 4, 4])

            We found that the solution of the system is <m>x = 4,\ y = 0</m>, and <m>z = 0</m>.

            We found that one solution to the system is <m>x = 4,\ y = 0</m>, and <m>z = 0</m>. 
            This is just one particular solution when the parameter is zero, 
            not all the infinitely many solutions of the system.

        Observe that in this case, Sage produces an error message. 
        Nevertheless, the error message states that the system has no solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid the error message and continue the execution of the program, we can write:
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = matrix([          # case iii
                    [1, 2, 0], 
                    [1, 2, 0], 
                    [1, 0, 2]  
                ])
            b = vector([4, 1, 4])
            try:
                A.solve_right(b)
            except Exception as e:
                print(e)
