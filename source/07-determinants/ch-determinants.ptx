            Matrices also support non-arithmetic, unary operations; operation that are applied
            to the matrix itself and its entrees. Two such operations are the <em>determinant</em>
            of a <em>square</em> matrix and its <em>inverse</em>.

            In this chapter, we will learn about a fundamental concept in linear algebra
            that is determinants, which provides important insights into the properties
            of matrices, and the linear transformation or the system of linear equations
            they represent.
