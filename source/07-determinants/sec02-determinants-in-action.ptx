            Cramer's rule is a theorem in linear algebra that provides an explicit formula for solving a system of
            linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, provided that the system's coefficient matrix is
            invertible (i.e., has a non-zero determinant).
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider a system of <m>n</m> linear equations with <m>n</m> unknowns represented in matrix form as
            <m>AX = B</m>, where <m>A</m> is the coefficient matrix, <m>X</m> is the column vector of unknowns,
            and <m>B</m> is the column vector of constants. According to Cramer's rule, if the determinant <m>\det(A)</m>
            is non-zero, then the system has a unique solution given by <m>x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}</m>, where
            <m>A_i</m> is the matrix formed by replacing the <m>i</m>-th column of <m>A</m> with the vector <m>B</m>.

        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 1], [5, 3]])
                det_A = A.det()

                B = vector([8, 19])

                A1 = matrix(A) # Create a copy of matrix A
                A1.set_column(0, B)
                det_A1 = A1.det()
                x1 = det_A1 / det_A

                A2 = matrix(A)
                A2.set_column(1, B)
                det_A2 = A2.det()
                x2 = det_A2 / det_A

            In this example, we solved the system of equations using Cramer's rule. To verify the solution,
            we can substitute the values of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> back into the original equations:

            <input>
                A * vector([x1, x2]) == B
