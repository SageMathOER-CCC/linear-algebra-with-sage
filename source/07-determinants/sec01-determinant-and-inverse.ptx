            The determinant of a square matrix <m>A</m> is a number <m>det(A)</m> that must satisfies the following key properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding a row to another row on <m>A</m> does not change <m>det(A)</m>.</li>
                <li>Scaling a row of <m>A</m> by a scalar <m>k</m> multiplies <m>det(A)</m> by <m>k</m>.</li>
                <li>Swapping two rows of a matrix <m>A</m> multiplies its  determinant by <m>-1</m>.</li>
                <li>The determinant of the identity matrix is <m>1</m>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the above definition, the following properties can be established:
            <ul>
                <li>The determinant of the zero matrix is <m>0</m>.</li>
                <li>If two rows of the matrix are identical, its determinant is <m>0</m>.</li>
                <li>If a matrix has a row of all zeros, its determinant is <m>0</m>.</li>
                <li>The determinants of a matrix and its transpose are equal: <m>\det(A^T) = \det(A)</m>.</li>
                <li>The determinant of a diagonal, or triangular matrix (upper or lower) is the product of its diagonal entries.</li>
                <li>The determinant of the product of two matrices equals the product of their determinants: <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)</m>.</li>
                <li>Performing a <em>row replacement</em> on <m>A</m> does not change <m>det(A)</m>.
                    In other words, replacing any one row by itself, plus a multiple of another row:
                    <m>\forall k \neq 0, R_i \leftarrow R_i + kÂ·R_j</m> (with <m>i \neq j</m>).</li>
            </ul>
            Note that all the above properties also hold true and extends for column operations as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> is a scalar value <m>det(A)</m> (also denoted <m>|A|</m>) that tells
            important information about the linear transformation represented by that matrix, such as whether tha matrix is
            invertible or how it scales space during transformations. In geometric terms for 2D and 3D space, the determinant
            of a square matrix measures the <em>signed area</em> of the parallelogram (in 2D) or the <em>signed volume</em>
            of parallelepiped (in 3D) formed by the row (or column) vectors of the matrix.

            In Sage, the determinant of a matrix can be computed using the <c>det</c> command:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]])
                A.det()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            A matrix is <em>singular</em> if it does not have an inverse, which occurs when its determinant is zero.
            In Sage, to check whether a matrix is singular or not the method <c>is_singular()</c> can be used.
            Note that just as with the determinant, this method is only applicable to square matrices.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                M = matrix([[1, 2], [2, 4]])
                M.is_singular()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            The matrix <m>M</m> is singular because its determinant is zero, hence does not have an inverse.
            Note that Sage offers several other methods to help check various properties of matrices related
            to determinants and inverses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Sage defines a method <c>is_square()</c> that returns <c>True</c> if the matrix is square.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                M.is_square()
            </input>
        </sage>

            The inverse of a matrix <m>A</m> is denoted as <m>A^{-1}</m> and is defined as the matrix that,
            when multiplied with <m>A</m>, yields the identity matrix. The inverse exists only if the determinant
            of the matrix is non-zero. In Sage, the inverse of a matrix can be computed using the <c>inverse</c> method:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A.inverse()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            The method <c>is_invertible()</c> returns <c>True</c> if the matrix has an inverse.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                M.is_invertible()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            The inverse of a matrix has several important properties:
            <ul>
                <li>The inverse of the identity matrix is itself: <m>I^{-1} = I</m>.</li>
                <li>The inverse of a product of matrices is the product of their inverses in reverse order: <m>(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}</m>.</li>
                <li>The inverse of a transpose is the transpose of the inverse: <m>(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T</m>.</li>
                <li>The inverse of an inverse returns the original matrix: <m>(A^{-1})^{-1} = A</m>.</li>
            </ul>
