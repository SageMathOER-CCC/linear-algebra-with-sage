            The determinant of a square matrix <m>A</m> is a number <m>det(A)</m> that must satisfies the following key properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding a row to another row on <m>A</m> does not change <m>det(A)</m>.</li>
                <li>Scaling a row of <m>A</m> by a scalar <m>k</m> multiplies <m>det(A)</m> by <m>k</m>.</li>
                <li>Swapping two rows of a matrix <m>A</m> multiplies its  determinant by <m>-1</m>.</li>
                <li>The determinant of the identity matrix is <m>1</m>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> is a scalar value <m>det(A)</m> (also denoted <m>|A|</m>) that tells
            important information about the linear transformation represented by that matrix, such as whether tha matrix is
            invertible or how it scales space during transformations. In geometric terms for 2D and 3D space, the determinant
            of a square matrix measures the <em>signed area</em> of the parallelogram (in 2D) or the <em>signed volume</em>
            of parallelepiped (in 3D) formed by the row (or column) vectors of the matrix.

            In Sage, the determinant of a matrix can be computed using the <c>det</c> command:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = matrix([[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]])
                A.det()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            A matrix is <em>singular</em> if it does not have an inverse, which occurs when its determinant is zero.
            In Sage, to check whether a matrix is singular or not the method <c>is_singular()</c> can be used.
            Note that just as with the determinant, this method is only applicable to square matrices.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                M = matrix([[1, 2], [2, 4]])
                M.is_singular()
            </input>
        </sage>
        <p>
            The matrix <m>M</m> is singular because its determinant is zero, hence does not have an inverse.
            Note that Sage offers several other methods to help check various properties of matrices related
            to determinants and inverses.
