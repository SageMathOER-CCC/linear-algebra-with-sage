            Vectors are used to represent quantities with both magnitude and direction. A vector is
            an ordered collection of numbers. In this section, we will see how to define vectors, and
            perform basic operations on them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sage provides built-in support for vectors. In Sage, vectors are represented as <m>n</m>-tuples,
            where <m>n</m> is the number of components in the vector. Vector can be defined using <c>vector</c>
            command, and passing the values of the vectors components
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                # creating a vector with 3 components
                v = vector([1, 2, 3])
                v
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            The number of components of a vector defines its dimensions or degrees of freedom. Sage defines
            the command <c>degree</c> to query the degrees of vector.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                v.degree()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            <idx>
                <h>Vectors</h>
                <h>Visual Representation</h>
            </idx>
            The geometrical representation of a vector can be visualized as an arrow starting from the origin
            to the point <m>(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)</m>. In 2D and 3D, the geometric representation is intuitive,
            but not so much in higher dimensions, where we should focus on abstract concepts rather than geometric
            representation. To display a vector in sage, we can use the internal method <c>plot</c> of
            <m>vector</m> class.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                # plotting the vector
                v.plot(color='red', thickness=2)
            </input>

        </sage>

        <p>
            We can also obtain the same visual representation using Sage default <c>plot</c> method.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                plot(v, color='red', thickness=2)
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            A vector in <m>R^n</m> has <m>n</m> components, one for each dimension. To retrieve the
            components of a vector as a list, the method <c>list</c> can be used
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                components = v.list()
                print(components, "are the components of the vector", v)
                print("The components of v is of type", type(components))
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            To access a specific component of a vector, we can use vector indexing method (0-based index).
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                # accessing the first component of the vector
                first_component = v[0]
                first_component
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p> The magnitude of a vector is a measure of its length, calculated using the Euclidean norm
            <m>||v|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}</m>. This magnitude gives us a scalar value
            representing how far the vector is from the origin.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                magnitude = v.norm()
                print("The magnitude of the vector", v, "is", magnitude)
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            A vector in <m>R^{n+1}</m> can be constructed from a vector in <m>R^n</m> by appending
            the values for the additional dimensions
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                # original 2D vector
                v = vector([1, 2])
                print("The original vector is", v)

                # extended the vector in to create a new 3D vector
                w = vector(v.list() + [3])
                print("The extended vector is", w)
            </input>
        </sage>
    </introduction>
