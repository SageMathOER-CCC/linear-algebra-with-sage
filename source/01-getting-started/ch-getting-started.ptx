  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Welcome to our introduction to SageMath (also referred to as Sage). This chapter is designed for
      learners of all backgrounds â€”whether you are new to programming or aiming to expand your mathematical
      toolkit. There are various ways to run Sage, including SageMathCell, CoCalc, and a local installation.
      The simplest way to start is by using the SageMathCell embedded in this book. We will also cover how
      to use CoCalc, a cloud-based platform for running Sage in a collaborative environment.

    <p>
      Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system that integrates
      <url href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/">various open-source math packages</url>.
      This chapter introduces Sage's syntax, data types, variables, and debugging techniques. Our goal is to
      equip you with the foundational knowledge to explore mathematical problems and programming concepts
      in an intuitive and practical manner.
