    <title>Vectors and Matrices</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Vectors and matrices are fundamental objects in linear algebra, playing a crucial
            role from representing mathematical entities (like lines, planes, and spaces) to
            modeling geometric and physical quantities (like velocity, acceleration, momentum,
            force, electric and magnetic fields), or representing linear transformations,
            systems of equations, and encode transformations and relationships between multiple
            multi-dimensional quantities. As such, they are central to many applications across
            various fields, from physics, to computer science, engineering, and data science.

            In this chapter, we introduce vectors and matrices, and how they are defined and used in Sage.
